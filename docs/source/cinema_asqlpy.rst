cinema_asqlpy
=============

*cinema_asqlpy* is a package that allows *SQL* queries
on *Cinema* Spec A databases in *Python*.

It does so by building a "virtual table" interface to
*Cinema* to *SQLite* via *apsw* (a *SQLite* interface
in Python that allows virtual tables).

Full information can be found on its `CinemaScience Github page <https://github.com/cinemascience/cinema_asqlpy>`_.
