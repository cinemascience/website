Spec C: Chaplin specification
=============================

Cinema Spec C extends the Simple database concept.  Multiple *data abtracts* such as floating point variables or derived quantities can be saved at each pixel, taking the 2D image concept to a 2D+ level.  This allows access to the actual data values, expanding the range of analysis approaches that can be applied a to a Cinema database.  The user also has the ability to have multiple variables available for visualization (turning on/off the different data abstracts) and can apply colormapping during visualization with a Cinema viewer. 

Detailed Spec C information can be found in the official write-up: `Chaplin (Spec C) <http://cinemascience.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/01/CinemaFileSpecification-chaplin_v1.0.pdf>`_.
