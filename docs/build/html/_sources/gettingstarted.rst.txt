Getting Started
===============

Cinema is an application-neutral approach to large data analysis, visualization and exploration. The foundation of Cinema is database specifications that provide a way for common data to be written and read by any application. We provide reference implementations of exporters and viewers, but these are by no means intended to be the only applications within the Cinema community.

A good way to get started is to read the `Supercomputing Paper <https://datascience.lanl.gov/data/papers/SC14.pdf>`_ that first described Cinemaâ€™s approach. From there, you can move on to reading the specifications, creating databases with our tools, or including Cinema-compliant components in your own workflows.
