Cinema Science Specifications
=============================

There are currently three active Cinema specifications or "Specs" with varying levels of functionality.  Official release documentation for each specification is available by clicking on the Specification Film Star name.  Follow the Specification links for details online.

* `Astaire (Spec A)`_ : This is a basic embodiment of the Cinema vision, and is the best way to get started with Cinema. It includes both static and spherical cameras, and includes the capability to turn elements on and off as detailed in the SC paper.  The resulting Spec A database is a colormapped visualization that can be viewed interactively with a standalone application viewer.
* Bacall (Spec B) : This is deprecated specification.
* `Chaplin (Spec C)`_ : This includes mobile cameras, floating point images, and data abstracts, the ability to change and apply colormaps, and fixes to previous specifications. It can be viewed with the same standalone application viewer as Spec A.
* `Dietrich (Spec D)`_ : This updated specification includes multiple files and arbitrary data.  It has a suite of flexible viewers, including a browser-based viewer and standalone viewer applications for a wide range of analysis approaches.
* Eastwood (Spec E) : To be implemented in an upcoming Cinema release.
